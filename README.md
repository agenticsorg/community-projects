# Agentics Foundation — Community Projects

Open source project intake and governance for the [Agentics Foundation](https://agentics.org).

Members of the Agentics Foundation can submit open source projects for review, support, collaboration, or inclusion in Foundation activities.

## Submit a Project

**[Submit your project here](../../issues/new?template=project-submission.yml)**

You must be a registered Foundation member in good standing. Your project must be in a public repository with a declared open source license.

### Submission Categories

| Category | What it means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Project Donation** | Transfer long-term stewardship to the Foundation |
| **Website Listing** | Featured on the Agentics Foundation website |
| **Co-Founder Search** | Connect with potential co-founders from membership |
| **Problem Support** | Help from members on a technical/architectural/organizational challenge |
| **Contributor Engagement** | Attract contributors, reviewers, or collaborators |

## Review Process

1. **Submit** — Fill out the issue template with your project details
2. **Triage** — Automated labeling and acknowledgment
3. **Scoring** — Committee members score using the [scoring rubric](docs/scoring-template.md) (5 criteria, 0–5 each, max 25)
4. **Escalation Vote** — Does this need senior leadership review? (majority vote)
5. **Validation Vote** — Approve, decline, or defer (majority vote)
6. **Registration** — Approved projects are added to `data/approved-projects.json`

Decisions can be revisited. Any committee member may propose retraction of a previously approved project if grounds exist.

## For Committee Members
