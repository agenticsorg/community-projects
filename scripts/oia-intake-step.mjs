 * True when `marker` already appears in one of this issue's comments.
 *
 * WHY. Every workflow in this repo can fire more than once for the same issue:
 * `opened` and `labeled` both trigger intake, a persist retry re-runs the whole
 * step, and a committee member re-applying a label to re-run the pipeline is a
 * supported remediation. On 2026-09-28 exactly that happened. All five open
 * submissions were label-cycled to backfill the notifications they never got
 * when the label race was live, and #51 and #53 each received a SECOND
 * "Added to the OIA Application Matrix" comment, because this script was the one
 * comment path without the guard its siblings got in #58.
 *
 * Pure and separately testable on purpose: the duplicate was not a networking
 * failure, it was a missing decision, and a missing decision should be covered
 * by a test rather than by care.
