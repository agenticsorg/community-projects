# Scoring Template

Committee members: copy the block below into an issue comment to submit your score.

## Slash Command Format

Post this as a comment on the submission issue:

```
/score mission:_ quality:_ clarity:_ impact:_ risk:_
```

Replace each `_` with a score from 0–5. Example:

```
/score mission:4 quality:3 clarity:5 impact:4 risk:3
```

**Total = sum of all five scores (max 25).**

## Score Scale

| 1 | Very weak alignment or quality |
| 2 | Below average, material gaps |
| 3 | Acceptable / baseline |

## Criteria

2. **Project Quality & Maturity (quality)** — Repo structure, documentation, license clarity, evidence of working code

4. **Community Impact (impact)** — Collaboration potential, relevance to members, likelihood of engagement
